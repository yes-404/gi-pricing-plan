"""Shared header parser and id grammar for NT-0019's document-id standard.

`docs/notes/0019-one-id-per-document.md` §1.1, §1.2, §1.5. Owned by W37-2
(`docs/plans/2026-09-01-nt-0019-id-standard-map-plan.md`); `scripts/doc-id.py` and
`scripts/doc-index.py` (W37-3) import this module and do not redefine any of it — it is
the one place the id grammar and the header's closed field set are stated.

**Standard library only** (G4 / DP-5): `.github/workflows/docs.yml` runs
`scripts/audit-docs.py` with no dependency-install step, so nothing under `scripts/` that
feeds that workflow may import a third-party package. The header is YAML front matter in
*form* only — NT-0019 §1.5's field set is closed and flat (scalars, `[a, b]` lists, `~` for
null), so a hand-rolled parser over exactly that grammar is a feature, not a shortcut: it
rejects anything PyYAML would silently accept (a nested mapping, an anchor, a tag) that the
standard does not use.

    The repository's own root `LICENSE` (`repo_root/LICENSE`) never counts: every path in
    the repository is transitively "under" it, so if it counted every file would read as
    vendored. Walks from `path` upward, stopping (and returning `False`) at `repo_root`
    itself without inspecting its `LICENSE`.

    A known, reported gap (2026-09-02): most of the skills this repository actually
    treats as vendored (`pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.ruff] exclude` list) do not carry a
    LICENSE file at all — the note's own §1.5 parenthetical names three of them
    (`graphify`, `systematic-debugging`, "the vue-* skills") as vendored while giving
    "ships a LICENSE" as the criterion; nine of the 28 ruff-excluded skills carry an
    NT-0019 §5.4 change row, two of which (`writing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development`)
    are creating instruments Ruling 66 places inside W37-6's own migration commit — so
    keying vendoring off that list instead would exempt from the migration the very

    and the fix is to what feeds this predicate — a declared constant reconciled against
    the ruff list so drift is loud — not to this function's published signature, which
    the ruling preserves. Apply the ruling once #563 merges; until then this implements
