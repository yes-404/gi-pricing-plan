description: Run the CI gate on your machine so it agrees with the runner — deriving the exact command, paths, markers, and env from the workflow file instead of the Makefile, unblocking gate steps that short-circuit and hide the next failure, pinning the linter version CI resolves, building the interpreter/toolchain environment the runner builds, and confirming the run is green instead of explaining a red job away. Use when a check passes locally but fails in CI (or the reverse), when a lint/format job goes red on an untouched file, when setting up a local dev loop for an unfamiliar repo, or before pushing a branch you expect to merge.

# Reproducing CI Locally

A local check is only useful if it runs the same thing the runner runs. Most
"green locally, red in CI" failures are not bugs in the code — they are a
difference between two commands: different paths, different test markers,
different env, a different linter version, or a different interpreter.

The fix is mechanical: **derive the local command from the workflow file**, not
from the Makefile, not from habit, not from what the last repo used.

## Read the workflow before you run anything

The workflow is the contract. The Makefile is a convenience that drifts from it.

```bash
# What the gate actually is, in order
sed -n '/jobs:/,$p' .github/workflows/ci.yml

# Every command CI runs, across all workflows
grep -rn "run:" .github/workflows/
```

Copy out four things, verbatim:

1. **The commands and their order.**
2. **The paths each command is scoped to** (`ruff check app tests scripts` is not
   `ruff check .`).
3. **Test selection** — marker expressions, `-k` filters, which suites are excluded.
4. **The `env:` block**, and the runtime/toolchain versions in `setup-*` steps.

Each of those four is a distinct way to get a wrong answer locally.

**Paths.** If CI lints `app tests scripts` and you run `ruff check .`, you get
findings from directories CI never looks at — a red that isn't a merge blocker
and shouldn't be "fixed" in an unrelated PR. Run it the narrow way to reproduce
the gate; run it the wide way only when you're deliberately auditing.

**Markers.** A suite-wide `make test` that excludes one marker is not the CI
gate if CI excludes six. Live-credential integration tests deselected in CI will
run locally, hit a fake key, and fail in a way that looks like a regression:

```bash
# Wrong: local shorthand — pulls in suites CI never runs
pytest -m "not browser"

# Right: the full expression, copied from the workflow
pytest -m "not browser and not slow and not load and not integration"
```

**Env.** Config objects instantiated at import time (a settings singleton at
module scope, an engine built when the module loads) make *collection* fail
without the workflow's variables — a wall of "Field required" errors that looks
like a broken suite. Mirror the `env:` block, including the *shape* of values:
if CI passes a Postgres URL and the module builds a pooled engine, a local
SQLite URL raises on arguments that dialect rejects before a single test runs.

Keep those values in a gitignored `.env.ci` copied from the workflow's `env:`
block, so the local command is the workflow command plus one `set -a`:

```bash
set -a; . ./.env.ci; set +a
pytest -m "not browser and not slow and not load and not integration"
```

## A short-circuiting gate hides the next failure

Gate steps run in order and the job stops at the first red. So the CI log shows
you *one* failure even when three are waiting:

```yaml
- run: ruff check .          # fails here …
- run: ruff format --check . # … so this never runs, and you never see it
```

You fix the lint error, push, and get an immediate second red for formatting.
Same shape everywhere: `cargo fmt --all -- --check` before `cargo clippy
--all-targets -- -D warnings` before `cargo test` means a formatting failure
tells you nothing about whether clippy or the tests pass.

**Run every gate step locally, even after one fails.** Don't `&&`-chain them
while diagnosing — run them separately and collect the whole set:

```bash
ruff check app tests scripts;  echo "lint:   $?"
ruff format --check app tests; echo "format: $?"
pytest -m "not integration";   echo "tests:  $?"
```

The corollary: after a red job, never report "only X is broken." Everything
downstream of X is unmeasured until you run it.

## Pin what gates the build, and reproduce the version CI resolves

An unpinned gating tool means the gate changes without a commit. A range like
`ruff>=0.4.0` resolves to whatever shipped this morning, and a release that
*widens file coverage* — a formatter that starts formatting code blocks inside
Markdown, a linter that promotes a rule to default — turns every open PR red on
files nobody touched.

Two habits:

- **Pin the linter, formatter, and toolchain** in the manifest, and bump them in
  a dedicated PR where the reformat is the whole diff.
- **Reproduce with the version CI resolves**, not the one you happen to have:

```bash
uvx ruff@0.16.4 format --check .      # exactly what the runner would install

# Node: CI does `npm ci` then `npx prettier --check web` — that's the LOCKFILE's
# prettier. A bare `npx prettier` fetches the latest and flags files CI is fine
# with. Read the pinned version, then ask for it.
grep -m1 -A2 '"node_modules/prettier"' package-lock.json
npx -y prettier@3.8.3 --check web
```

Formatting a file CI never complained about is not a fix — it's an unrelated
diff caused by using a different tool than the gate.

## Build the environment the runner builds

Package managers will happily invent an environment for you, and the one they
invent is not CI's.

- **A fresh clone or worktree has no virtualenv.** `uv run <tool>` silently
  creates a bare one *without* your dev extras, then fails with `Failed to
  spawn: ruff` — which reads like a missing dependency rather than a missing
  environment.
- **`uv run` re-syncs from the lockfile** against your *host* interpreter. On a
  Python newer than CI's matrix, a pinned dependency with no wheel for that
  version gets built from source and fails on a compiler error that has nothing
  to do with your change.
- **Extras differ.** If CI installs `[dev,web]` and `make install` installs
  `[dev]`, the full suite errors at collection locally on an import CI has.

Build it explicitly, at CI's interpreter version, with CI's extras:

```bash
uv venv .venv --python 3.12 --seed
uv pip install --python "$PWD/.venv/bin/python" -e ".[dev,web]"
.venv/bin/python -m ruff check app tests scripts
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -m "not integration"
```

Driving the tools as `.venv/bin/python -m <tool>` sidesteps the re-sync entirely.
If you prefer `uv run`, pass `--no-sync`. And prefix with `env -u VIRTUAL_ENV`
when a shell profile exports one — otherwise the run is silently redirected into
an unrelated environment and its results mean nothing.

## Fix divergence in shared config, not in the workflow

When you find a difference, ask where the fix belongs. A flag added to the
workflow YAML fixes CI and leaves every local run diverging — so the next person
hits the same confusion.

Prefer the file both sides read:

- Test-runner flags → `addopts` in `pyproject.toml`, not the workflow's `run:`.
  (Import-mode is the classic one: a source directory on `sys.path` shadowing an
  installed compiled package is a *config* problem, and pinning
  `--import-mode=importlib` in `addopts` fixes local and CI together.)
- Marker definitions, coverage thresholds, lint rules and target version → the
  project manifest.
- Keep `requires-python` and the linter's `target-version` in sync; a mismatch
  means the linter applies rules for a runtime you don't support.

The workflow should read as `make lint` / `make test` plus the environment. When
it contains flags the local target doesn't, that's the divergence.

## Know which checks are actually gates

Not every command in the repo is a merge blocker, and treating them as equal
wastes PRs.

```bash
# Which jobs are required is a repo setting, not a file — check it
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches/main/protection --jq '.required_status_checks.contexts'
```

If CI runs the linter but not the type checker, then a pre-existing type error in
an untouched module is not blocking your PR — don't fold a speculative fix for it
into an unrelated change, and don't claim CI verifies types. The inverse matters
too: a helper target like `make quality-check` that runs *more* than CI will show
you reds that no one is gating on.

## Adding a file puts tests in scope that touching code does not

**A change that only *adds* files can red suites nothing in the diff touches**, because this
repository has **tree-scanning invariant tests** — they walk `git ls-files` and assert a property
of the whole corpus, so their input is the tree, not the diff. Known ones include
`backend/tests/test_lineage.py` (no bundled reference-data rows), `tests/test_notes_move_citations.py`
(no living file cites the retired notes path), and the repository-invariant and doc-id suites.

**`pytest --collect-only` cannot warn you.** Collection is unchanged — the same tests exist, and
they were already passing. What changed is the corpus they read at run time. So the usual
lightweight local check, *"collect to catch import breakage, then run the files I touched"*, is
**blind to this entire class**, and blind in the reassuring direction: it goes green.

**Recorded 2026-09-02 from a live instance.** A docs-only PR adding a `.csv` and a `.md` under
`docs/audit/` passed `ruff`, `mypy`, `lint-imports`, `audit-docs.py` and `req-coverage.py` locally,
then failed CI on **two** such tests — the CSV read as bundled data, and both new files contained a
literal the notes-move check forbids **because the record was about that path**. Neither is
reachable from the diff.

**So: if your change adds or moves a tracked file, run the tree-scanning suites**, whatever else
you scope. They are cheap relative to the full run and they are the only ones your file can break
without appearing to. The agent that hit this then ran five such suites unprompted — 281 passed,
no third failure — which converts *"I fixed the two CI reported"* into *"I checked whether CI had
reported all of them."*

**Two traps inside the fix, both refused and both worth naming.** A file flagged by a glob can be
renamed out of it (`.csv` → `.csv.txt`), and a forbidden literal can be broken up with a
zero-width character. **Both satisfy the detector while defeating the purpose**, and both fail again
the moment the check is reasonably hardened. Where a document legitimately *names* a thing a check
forbids — a citation rather than a use — describe it in prose instead: the notes-move test's own
docstring says *"the old notes root under `.claude`"* and builds the literal by concatenation so it
does not flag itself, which is the established form.

## Finish by confirming the run, not by explaining it

"Passes locally" is a prediction. Wait for the real result:

```bash
gh pr checks --watch
gh run view --log-failed        # the failing step's output, not the summary
```

When a job is red, fix it in the same PR if the fix is feasible. If you believe
it's pre-existing, **prove it**: check out the base commit and run the same
command there. An unverified "pre-existing / out of scope" is how a base branch
becomes permanently red.

Two traps in the log itself:

- A step gated on an event (`if: github.event.action == 'opened'`) is skipped
  when you re-run by pushing a commit. Green-on-rerun can mean *not run*.
- A permissions failure at the last step (an HTTP 403 posting a comment) shows
  every build/test step green with a red X on the job — read which step failed
  before concluding the code is broken.

```
Before running anything:
- [ ] Read .github/workflows/*.yml — commands, order, paths, markers, env, versions

- [ ] Tools driven from that venv (`.venv/bin/python -m …` or `--no-sync`)
- [ ] `env -u VIRTUAL_ENV` when a shell profile exports one
- [ ] Gating linter/formatter/toolchain pinned; local run uses the pinned version

Running:
- [ ] Every gate step run separately — a first failure hides the rest
- [ ] Formatter check run even when the linter passed (they are different tools)

Fixing:
- [ ] Divergence fixed in shared config (manifest/addopts), not only in the workflow
- [ ] Checked which jobs are actually required before treating a red as blocking
- [ ] Waited for the real run; any red either fixed here or proven on the base commit
